Bubble Bobble Arcade Achievements

**************************************************************************************************
It's my hope that this format will help future Junior Devs organize and visualize the process of achievement development by providing a step by step process 
which includes both code and code comments that explain the purpose of the code.

I am using the achievement editor, not RATools. The lines of code are in order that they are populated into the achievement editor.

The general format for "code" here will generally be as follows:

Achievement Name - "Title of Achievement"
  Code Line 1 // Code Comments
  Code Line 2 // Code Comments
  
I will utilize both hexadecimal values in the code and their associated decimal values in parenthesis to accomodate developers that may chose to use either method. 
As an example, in the code line "Mem 8-bit 0x394b = Value 0x01 (1)", this represents a memory location at 0x394b that is equal to the hex value 0x01 or simply, 1,
which can be seen in the parenthesis immediately after 0x01. Clicking on the "Show Decimal" box on the bottom right of the achievement editor will toggle
between these values.
****************************************************************************************************
  

Level Based (0x394b) // Recall that Level 1 is technically 0x00 (0), so we will test for mem address of 0x01 (1) and a delta check that the address incremented
                     // from 0x00 (0; level 1) to 0x01 (1; level 2). 
  Complete Level 1 - "The First of Many"
    Mem 8-bit 0x394b = Value 0x01 (1)
    Delta 8-bit 0x394b > Value 0x00 (0)

  Complete Level 10 - "Ten Down"
    Mem 8-bit 0x394b = Value 0x0a (10) // Checking that the mem address is now 10 (level 11)
    Delta 8-bit 0x394b > Value 0x09 (9) // Delta check that there was an increment from level 10 to 11
  
  Complete Level 20 "Twenty Piece"
    Mem 8-bit 0x394b = Value 0x14 (20) // Checking that the mem address is now 20 (level 21)
    Delta 8-bit 0x394b > Value 0x13 (19) // Delta check that there was an increment from level 20 to 21
  
  Complete Level 30
  Complete Level 40
  Complete Level 50
  Complete Level 60
  Complete Level 70
  Complete Level 80
  Complete Level 90
  Complete Level 100 - Super Bubble Bobble, No Warps, 1CC - "Ultimate True and Happy End!!"
      May need to figure out if there is a way to "if/then" the achievement in such a way that the super bobble bobble cheat can be activated and if any other
      cheats are activated or in effect at the start of the run in question that it would invalidate the achievement.
      
      There is an easy mode and a powered up mode that can be activated at the title screen, consider logic such as
        if super mode = true AND easy mode + powered up NOT activated, make icon in bottom right appear to let player know that 1CC achievement is active.
  Complete Level 100 - Single Player - "Never Forget Your Friend!"
  Complete Level 100 - Two Player - "Better End!!"
  Complete Level 100 - Super Bubble Bobble - "True and Happy End!!"

Score Based
  Score 30,000 Points Default High Score
  Score 150,000 Points

  Score 1,000,000 Points

Secret Room Based
  Find the first secret room (Round 20)
